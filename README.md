# SplitFree

This project is a replica of the popular Splitwise app, designed to handle unlimited expense entries and calculate minimal settlements between users using complex mathematical algorithms. The app ensures efficient expense splitting by reducing redundant transactions, making it ideal for managing group expenses seamlessly.

## Features:
- Add unlimited expenses with detailed descriptions and amounts.
- Automatically calculates the minimal set of transactions to settle all debts between users.
- Intuitive interface for easy tracking and managing group expenses.
- Advanced algorithms to optimize the distribution of costs and minimize redundant exchanges.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Backend)
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Reactjs(Frontend)
- Postgresql (Database)
- Tailwindcss(Styling)
- Custom mathematical formulas for optimal expense splitting.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your environment with the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the app and start adding expenses!
